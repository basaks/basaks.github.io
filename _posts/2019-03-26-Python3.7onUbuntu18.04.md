title: Install Python3.7 interpreter on ubuntu 18.04
---

[From here](http://devmartin.com/blog/2016/04/creating-a-virtual-environment-with-python3.4-on-ubuntu-16.04-xenial-xerus/), we can pretty much follow the exact same procedure.

On top of that blog the only thing I needed was the `libffi-dev` system 
dependency.
  

On a terminal just do the following steps:

Install dependencies:

    sudo apt install build-essential checkinstall libreadline-gplv2-dev \
	libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev \
	libbz2-dev openssl libffi-dev

Download and untar the desired version: 
	
	mkdir -p $HOME/opt
	cd $HOME/opt
    curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.2/Python-3.7.2.tgz
    tar -xzf Python-3.7.2.tgz 
    

Install python3.7 while keeping python3.5 as the default python3 version on 
ubuntu 16.04.
    
    cd Python-3.7.2/
    ./configure --enable-shared --enable-optimizations --prefix=/usr/local LDFLAGS="-Wl,--rpath=/usr/local/lib"
    sudo make altinstall


Check it was installed properly:

    >> python3.7 -V

    Python 3.7.2
    
Enjoy!

NB: If you need jupyter notebook installed, [see this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50874632).
